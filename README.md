# Predictive Modeling for Gender and Ad Click Classification
This repository contains a Python-based pipeline for predicting gender and ad click behavior using classification models. The workflow includes model training, hyperparameter tuning, performance evaluation, and model persistence.

Features
#Classification Models:  Decision Tree.
#Hyperparameter Tuning: Implements GridSearchCV for optimal parameter selection.
#Performance Metrics: Confusion matrix, ROC curve, and evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
#Model Persistence: Trained models are saved as .pkl files.
#Dataset
